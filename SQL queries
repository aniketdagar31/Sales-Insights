SQL queries used to gain key insights on the dataset and verify Power BI calculations. I used MYSQL workbench to work on the dataset of around 1,50,000 records.

1.	SELECT * FROM customers;

2.	SELECT count(*) FROM customers;

3.	SELECT * FROM transactions where market_code='Mark001';

4.	SELECT distinct product_code FROM transactions where market_code='Mark001';

5.	SELECT * from transactions where currency="USD";

6.	SELECT transactions.*, date.* FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020;

7.	SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020 
and transactions.currency="INR\r" or transactions.currency="USD\r";
	
8.	SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020 
and and date.month_name="January" and (transactions.currency="INR\r" or transactions.currency="USD\r");

9.	SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020 
and transactions.market_code="Mark001";
